## Description:
Goal-E is a full-stack application that was developed to help users write goals. The user is given the option to "get started" or "log in". After signing up or logging in, the user can create a goal and add a description. The created goal will appear in the profile. Once a goal is created, then the user can edit that goal. An option also exists to complete the goal, which deletes it from the profile.
On the back-end, we created models and routes that allow us to GET, POST, UPDATE, and DELETE goals.

## Technologies Used:
-bcrypt- Used for encrypting passwords

-connect-session-sequelize and express-session- Used for session (loggedin syntax)

-dotenv- Used for keeping private developer passwords for SQl safe

-express- Used for the server

-express-handlebars- Used for views template for HTML

-mysql2 and sequelize- Used for database and models

-nodemon- used to keep the server running

## Future Capabilites:
In the code, there is a model, Checklist, that exists to provide a checklist that would be attached to the created goal. This would allow the user to outline specific steps to take to complete the goal. 

Another future capability would be to provide a more detailed form that follows the SMART model to structure the goals.
